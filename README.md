# Code Institute, Milestone 4: Farm2Table

## Introduction

Over the past decade, the world has truly become a global economy. Global supply chain expansion has provided unparalleled choice for the consumer. In relation to the food industry, the term 'out of season' has become a thing of the past. No longer do we have to wait until the summer months to enjoy berries or winter for citrus fruits. With the popularity of grocery chains such as Lidl & Aldi, locally sourced fruit & vegetables are being phased out for cheaper produce which is normally shipped halfway across the globe. To endure this expedition, the produce is harvested well before it has reached maturity and ripened in shipping containers by the use of 'controlled environments'. This produce tends to turn bad very quickly due to this unnatural journey, sometimes within 48 hours of purchase causing massive food wastage. Most of us have lost the connection to the food we eat.

With my final milestone project for Code Institute, I will attempt to tackle this problem within our society. My goals is to get Ireland eating locally & in season again by creating a marketplace to connect local producers with consumers. My project Farm2Table aims to reduce the friction associated with sourcing local produce by having all local producers of fruit & veg in one marketplace. This environment will inspire competition between producers, allowing the consumers to easily find the best price for their local fruit & veg.

### Notes for Assessment Team


### Future Features

This section will outline potential features which I would like to implement in the future.

* Loyalty point system through a native cryptocurrency
* 


## Considerations

### Use Cases


## UX

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to get Ireland eating locally again by creating a marketplace where fruit & vegetable producers will post listings of their produce. This format will increase competition between the farmers as consumers can compare prices directly. Payment will be taken through the application in order to reduce friction once the customer goes to collect their order or has it delivered.

## User Stories

### User Goals

Potential users for this application can be split into 2 groups listed below. It is essential to be mindful of specific needs of both of these user types.

1. Producers
2. Consumers

#### User Needs (Producers)

For this application to be successful we will need to onboard as many fruit & vegetable producers across the country in order to create a competitive marketplace for the consumer. We need to make the registration process as easy as possible.

In order for a seller to be willing to join our app, they will need:

* Access to a phone/computer to maintain their store's dashboard.
* A European Bank Account in order to receive card payments via Stripe.

##### Producer Goals

* To expand my customer base.
* Cultivate an online presence, the benefit of free online advertising.

#### User Needs (Consumers)

The target audience for this application will be users over the age of 25. This is due to the fact that they are generally more concerned about the source/quality of their produce & have access to more discretionary income. Users of the application will be in search of the highest quality fruit & vegetables at the most affordable price.

As a user of this application, I need:

* A central marketplace where I can browse different producers and compare pricing.
* The ability to filter the marketplace to only show sellers within my vicinity.
* Ways to identify how local producers compare to one another in order to make an informed purchase.
* A clean UX that is easy to navigate while also remaining fresh and exciting.
* A quick and simple way to create an account with little to no friction.
* The ability to make purchases using my credit/debit card.
* To be able to quickly identify which sellers can deliver to my area.

##### Consumer Goals

* To eat the best quality produce sourced close to me.
* To find the best price for locally grown produce.
* To support local business.


### Developer & Business Goals

This section will outline my goals as the developer of the project, what the future of the website holds & how to generate revenue from the application.

#### Developer Goals

My goals as the developer of this project are:

1. To provide a neutral platform that will allow grocers to sell directly to the consumer.
2. Provide Stripe integration which will allow payment's to be sent directly to the merchant's bank account.
3. Create a clean and intuitive UI which keeps users.
4. Allow merchant's goods to be in full focus by cultivating an immersive UX for the user that keeps them coming back to shop with us.
5. Once a robust marketplace has been formed within Ireland, the application can be launched in localised foreign markets.


#### Business Goals

Currently, I have identified 3 possible streams of income this project would be able to generate. 

1. A small fee will be applied to each purchase made within the application for connecting the producer with the consumer & processing payment between the 2 parties.
2. Producers will have the ability to purchase premium Farm2Table memberships giving them access to additional features, such as being highlighted on the front page of the website, ad-free storefronts.
3. Advertising revenue will be generated from the web traffic on the application.

    * A clean and enjoyable UX, everything should be where I want it.
    * Fonts that are legible but something a bit different to the norm.
    * Little to no load times when the website first starts or has to complete a process.

2. As somebody looking to advertise on this website I would like:
    * Content that is family friendly and not provocative, so our brand doesn't become tarnished.
    * Heavy user traffic in order to get our brand in front of as many eyeballs as possible.
    * Fast load times to ensure impatient users don't leave the site.


### Design Choices

#### Favicon

I really enjoy this favicon which was sourced from [Favicon.cc](https://www.favicon.cc/?action=icon&file_id=636006)

![Favicon](static/favicon.ico)

#### Responsive Front-End Framework

For this project, I decided to use the Materialize framework which is build on the principles of material design. I have previous experience with this framework as I encorporated it into my third milestone project. Throughout the course of this project, the lack of thorough documentation & package support for this framework have turned me off using it in future.

#### Icons

All icons for this application have been sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/icons) collected from the Material Icons library. As the designer of the web application, the selection of the icons must be done in line with other successful applications. 

##### Favourite Outline Icon

This icon is present on the product_details page when you are logged in to the application. By pressing the button linked to it, the user has the ability to add products to their wishlist.

##### Favourite Icon

Present on the product_details page, if a user's wishlist already contains this specific product, the empty heart icon will be replaced by the full heart.


#### Fonts

The impact that font choice can have on a web application cannot be understated. Web design trends over the past decade have shown that clear and extremely legible sans-serif fonts leads to a dramatic reduction in the user bounce rate. All fonts used within this application have been sourced from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/icons).

##### Logo Font

The extreme legibility of a font can be sacrificed in the case that is to be displaying the company's logo. For THEVEGTABLE.ie, I have chosen a font named Fjalla One, a sans-serif font that catches the eye while still remaining fully legible to the user.

##### Content Font

The font chosen for the rest of the application's content should be lightweight and extremely legible. This allows the user to relax while browsing through the website as they are not having to strain their eyes when moving from one piece of content to the other. The Lato font was chosen for this task due to its sharp and clean look.


#### Colours

During the design process, I wanted to colour pallet of the application to take inspiration from nature. Greens & Beige have been used to remind the user that purchasing produce locally has a massive effect on the environment and that they're making a 'green' choice.


##### Materialize Button



## Key Frontend Design Elements

This section will outline the key elements within this application giving descriptions on the purpose of each element.


#### Lottie Player Animations

Lottie provides lightweight animation hosting which provides significantly smaller footprint than conventional animations.

## Django App Structure

This section of the documentation will outline the function behind each self-contained Django application.

##### Farm2Table App

This app is responsible for the Django configuration of the entire project as well as organising the URL paths for each sub-application.

##### Profile App

This application controls information in relation to the UserProfile model such as contact details & their order history. It also contains authentication features such as login & signup.

##### Store App

Once a UserProfile is created, the application user can establish a sales organisation and connect it to their UserProfile. Once on the store page, store owners can edit their store's contact details. This is also where the County model resides.

##### Products App

This Django application gives the ability to store owners so that they can create, edit & delete products. Each product is connected to a Category model in order to enable product filtering.

##### Wishlist App

This app keeps track of a list of products favourited by the user. Favourited items can be removed at any time.

##### Bag App

The bag application hosts the shopping cart, allowing the user to gather products before proceeding to the checkout. The size & quantity of the each item within the bag can be updated.

##### Checkout App

In the checkout, the user submits their shipping details and card information. Here is where the order is processed and Stripe payment is established.

##### Media App

Stores Images


## User Interaction


### Implementation

This section will outline the technologies & processes used in the design & implementation of this application.

### Materialize Framework

For this project, the frontend framework I decided to use was Materialize. In my previous 2 milestone projects, I chose Bootstrap for the frontend, but I can now safely say that I much prefer the look of Materialize.
As it is based on the principles of material design, all elements just seem that little bit sharper and current.

### Error Handling


#### Django Messages

This section outlined the technology used to pass the user information without refreshing the page. These notifications appear when:

* Adding/Removing/Adjusting products to/from the bag
* Adding/Removing products to/from the user's watch list
* Adding/Updating/Removing a product to/from the store
* A user updates their profile
* A store owner updates their store profile


##### Custom Django Message Tags

Django messages allows developers to create custom message tags to allow for more granular UX notifications. As you can see from the image below, two new message tags have been created for this project. 

* Checkout[50] - In charge of displaying the shopping cart modal to the user whenever they add an item to the cart
* Wishlist[60] - Allow for a custom modal when the adds/removes items from their wish list


#### API Exceptions


#### Other Low Level Exceptions

Other low level exceptions such as client-side errors (4xx) or server-side errors (5xx) will also be handled, describing to the user which error occurred. The user will also have an option to either return to their homepage or the login page depending on their credentials. 

### Database Design

#### UserProfile Model

#### Store Model

#### Product Model

#### Wishlist Model

#### Order Model

#### Order Line Item Model

#### CRUD Operations

One of the main goals of this milestone project was to integrate a database within our application and use it to it's full potential. CRUD in computer programming is an acronym which stands for create, read, update & delete. This covers the 4 main operations of a database. Within this section I will go over how I implemented each of these operations.

##### Create Operation


##### Read Operation


##### Update Operation


##### Delete Operation



#### Flask

Flask is a web application framework written in Python based on the Werkzeug toolkit & the Jinja2 templating language. During my development of this application is when I noticed the usefulness of flask, getting to experiment with the different flask libraries. Jinja templating also opened a lot of doors for me as a web developer when managing repeated pre-defined data.


### Modules


## Performance

#### Image Resizing & Compression

Due to the nature of the application, no image compression was needed as all design elements are from the Materialize framework. No images were used in the making of this application.


#### Lottie Player Animations

By using the Lottie animation player, we can bring beautiful animations into our application without having to worry about file size and hence performance. I have used a single hosted Lottie animation on the error.html page.


###### Autoprefixing

The CSS style rules have been [Autoprefixed](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) to maintain uniformity of style rules across all browsers.


## Testing

### User Testing

As the application began to take shape with all major components in place, the user testing could commence. This was done by reviewing each component line by line to ensure that the code works as intended. If an edit was to be made, the developer made sure to the changes were reflected correctly on the frontend.
